            <p class="content">We plan to make PvP unrestricted in many areas that are rich with recourses and money. Forcing players who want riches to fight it out for the top, embracing the high-risk-high-reward mantra.
                
            There are many things we have to tackle in order to make a truly remarkable and balance PvP experience. For starters we wont allow fighting unless the target is within a certain level of the aggresor within these restricted areas.
                
            We really want to emphasize PvP, hopefully even encouraging it during some of the main story or quests. We do, however, want to stray away from forcing anything onto players. Allowing artisans and PvMers to thrive as well, hopefully adding dungeons and artisan missions along the way.</p>
